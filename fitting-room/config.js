  /* ── "Upload Your Own Garment" — client-side detection + crop tuning ─────────
     Every timing / threshold the upload → detect → crop flow uses lives HERE (per
     the project's "zero hardcoded timings" rule); app.js reads CONFIG.UPLOAD and
     never redefines these.

     DETECTOR CHOICE — vanilla canvas, not MediaPipe. MediaPipe's shipped Object
     Detector model (EfficientDet/COCO) has NO apparel classes ("clothing/top/
     bottom/dress" aren't in COCO), so it cannot reliably box garments, and it adds
     a multi-MB WASM+model CDN dependency that can 404 — against this codebase's
     "bulletproof, self-contained, no external path to break" ethos. Instead we use
     a dependency-free background-subtraction + connected-components pass
     (detectGarments() in app.js): estimate the background colour from the image
     border, mask the foreground, dilate to close gaps, then label blobs into
     garment bounding boxes. It runs fully offline and handles flat-lays, white
     backgrounds AND model-worn photos. Swap in MediaPipe later by adding its CDN
     URL here and replacing detectGarments()'s body — the rest of the flow is
     detector-agnostic (it only consumes {xmin,ymin,width,height} boxes). */
