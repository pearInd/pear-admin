   Supabase client — created ONLY when both env vars are present.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   IMPORTANT: createClient("") throws "supabaseUrl is required." synchronously.
   If we called it unconditionally at module load and SUPABASE_URL were missing,
   the throw would crash the ENTIRE serverless function on cold start — taking
   down every route, including ones that never touch the database (token proxy,
   image proxy, health, the size calculator, camera/MediaPipe assets).

   So instead: if either env var is missing we log a warning and export `null`.
   Callers must null-check `supabase` and return a clear error response rather
   than dereferencing it — the rest of the site keeps working regardless.
